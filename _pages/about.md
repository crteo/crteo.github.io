A few facts about me:

🏫 I am a penultimate Mechanical Engineering student at National University of Singapore. 

📚 I enjoy learning new things in my free time. Current skills I'm pursuing are 💻 Data Science and Machine Learning, as well as 📈 Investment and Portfolio Management.

👨‍🏫 I love to educate and I used to teach Physics (GCE 'O' and 'A' Levels) full-time at a tuition centre while I was in my first two years of University.

What is this personal website for?
======
It's for myself, really, and for a multitude of reasons.

In my free time, I pick up new skills from online platforms, and I would love to have a place to:

✍ Reflect on my experiences and truly think about the importance of why I'm doing what I'm doing.

👨🏻‍💻 Interact with my learnings by having a platform to apply what I learn through sharing

📚 Share about my learning in as simple a way as possible, to re-teach the future me, who might've forgotten what I've learnt or what I've experienced.

Additionally, pivotal moments often flash past us in a blink of an eye, and writing is a way for me to hold on to these memories and the emotions associated with it, for me to remember who I am, who I was, and understand who I am going to be.

🤝 A side bonus, is that whoever is reading this, can get to know me better =) 

Navigating
======
I've spent the bulk my time in 2022-2023 teaching. You can find my reflections and testimonials from teaching under the "Teaching" Tab.

As I make some minor attempts at applying what I've learnt from the online courses I'm taking (through both projects and posts to educate), you can find my projects under "Personal Projects". 

I've spent most of 2024 working overseas and travelling. Alongside this experience, posts regarding the explanation of a certain concept I've learnt can all be found under "Blog Posts".

**P.S.**
This page is still a very large "Work in Progress", so you may see some weird stuff around :)
